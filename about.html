        The world became a little bit better place on September 1, 2006. Evin Wolff entered this world on a
        early Friday morning. It didn’t take long for him to start displaying the traits he uses to best
        describe himself, smart, caring, and always helpful. Over the course of his first 15 years, he has
        developed many friendships. Many of these friendships have been developed through his passion and
        love of sports. One of the things that makes him the happiest is spending time with friends and
        playing sports with them. If there was a typical day for Evin, it’s going to school and then going
        to practice for the sport that is currently in season. Outside of school and sports, another passion
        of his is online gaming, again, with his friends. His main focus this year is to complete his first
        year of high school and continue to grow and develop as a baseball player. It’s no surprise that
        he aspires to be a baseball player when he is older. Along with that goal, he also sees himself working
        on cars. If given the opportunity to be anywhere in the world at any moment, he would choose to be
        in Chicago, with his favorite team, the Chicago Cubs. Having already attended a game to see his favorite
        baseball team in his favorite city, one team that is on his bucket list is the Kansas City Chiefs. With
        so many activities and interests to keep him busy, on most Sundays he can usually be found sleeping in
        after some late night gaming, and attending church with his family.
